        question: "Under what circumstances does the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) become clogged, and how do I avoid this?",
        answer: "The Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) is an emission-control device located in the exhaust system, designed to trap and reduce particulate matter (PM) from diesel engine emissions. The DPF may become clogged if the vehicle is frequently driven at low speeds for a long period of time or by frequent short journeys where exhaust temperatures remain low. In such situations, please follow the below guidance: 1. In case DPF Indicator Blinking/Flashing: Drive the vehicle continuously for approximately 30 minutes at a minimum speed of 20 km/h until the indicator turns off. 2. In case DPF Indicator is Continuously ON: Visit the nearest authorized Honda dealer immediately for inspection and corrective action. Following these steps ensures proper DPF functioning and helps maintain engine performance while keeping emissions under control."

        question: "My vehicle experienced a severe impact, but the airbags did not deploy. What could be the reason for this occurrence?",
        answer: "The Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) is designed to deploy airbags only under specific conditions where they can provide maximum protection. If the impact is not near the front of the vehicle or not severe enough, the sensors on the airbag deployment system may not be triggered, and the airbags will not activate. Since crushable body parts absorb crash energy during an impact, visible damage does not always indicate airbag operation. Some collisions can result in severe damage without airbag deployment because the airbags would not have been needed or would not have provided additional protection.<br><br>It is recommended to have your vehicle inspected at a Honda authorized dealership after any moderate-to-severe collision to ensure a thorough check of the vehicle and to provide complete clarity on its condition."

Even minor collisions, impacts to the vehicle frame, suspension, curbs, or potholes can trigger airbag deployment.<br><br>After an airbag deploys, it is important to have your vehicle inspected at a Honda authorized dealership. The airbags, control unit, and any activated seat belt tensioners must be replaced to ensure the SRS system functions correctly in future incidents.
